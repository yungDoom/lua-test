# Lua Test

<dl>
  <dt>My first ever Lua script except Roblox.</dt>
  <dd>I was coding at Roblox semi-professionally but decided to code with the Real *Lua* first time, so here is the testing script that i made. <br> Not compatible with roblox by the way.</dd>
</dl>

You can own Lua binaries or the source code from here: <br>
https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/ <br> https://www.lua.org/download.html

Built in linux, so i writed this script(shit) for linux-only. <br>
Type **`./lua54 test.lua`** for opening it.

Warning: this code creates bunch of file so be careful when you open it.
